# Pragmatic Python
> Friends Don't Let Friends Write Mediocre Code

## About This Book

So, you’re pragmatic, eh? Pragmatic Python is a book my alter-ego always wanted
to write to my democratic self. It is fiercely opinionated way to programming
with Python.

I bring a hefty dose of Danish sarcasm to the table and don’t take everything
too seriously—because, let’s be real, religiously following ideas, best
practices, design patterns or rules is a total buzzkill (and frankly
anti-pragmatic). It’s for my book, Pragmatic Python, of course.
