# Pragmatic Mindset

`/praɡˈmatɪk/` _adjective_ - dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a
way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations. -
Oxford's Google Dictionary

Python’s got a million ways to write code—functional, OOP, whatever. A pragmatic
mindset says, I don’t care about the paradigm fetish. I care about code that
works, changes without a meltdown, and doesn’t make onboarding a nightmare. If I
can’t understand and test it in ten minutes, it’s trash.
