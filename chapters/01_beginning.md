# Pragmatic Python Package Managers

Forget juggling [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) and [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv). The future is [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a complete, pragmatic, all-in-one solution for Pythonâ€™s ecosystem. It is the one ring to rule them all. If your organization is married to the [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/) ecosystem, go for [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/).

Stick with `uv` or `pixi`, and youâ€™ll thank me later.

#### Structure Like You Mean It 
> Friends Donâ€™t Let Friends Mess with System Path
  
If you are battling circular imports or shoving `sys.path` hack to make your code run, congratsâ€”you are slinging mediocre joker codeâ€”pure clown nonsense, project structure so tangled they would make a Dane yeet their Carlsberg.

This chapter is about structure: code and project, built for ETCâ€”easy to change, test, onboard. Why? Control. A pragmatic designed system keeps bugs, delays, and costs from screwing your reputation and your company, a distance. Like milk on the fridge door or the trash bin under the kitchen's sink, everything ought to be where it belongsâ€”because losing controlâ€™s not an option.

##### 1.1 Structure is Your Danish Kontrol

You are in WC, our favourite quiet office room,  picture this, the toilet paper is across the room. You reach for itâ€”shit gets messy, literally. That is code without structure. In a Danish flat, the bin is under the kitchen sink, milk is on the fridge door, butter is in its slotâ€”order kills chaos. Danes are busy being happy. No time for messy.

A Python project is no different. Misplace a file, and you are out of control: bugs creep, shipping stalls, your reputation tanks, production costs skyrocket. A pragmatic project structure means it is ETCâ€”easy to change, test, onboard. It puts you in charge. No hunting, no cursing. 

Use `uv init --lib` and two `SOLID` principlesâ€”`Single Responsibility (S)` and `Dependency Inversion (D)`â€”to craft a system as tight as a Copenhagen kitchen. Yes, you heard me correct, principles also applies to our project structure as much as they apply to the code we write.

##### 1.2 Setp 1: Clean Slate - `uv init --lib`

Let create a pragmatic project repository, `nudge`. A nudging book recommendation system project. We, of cause, will start with `uv init --lib nudge`. It is like stepping into a Danish flatâ€”bare, logical, ready for `hygge`. You get `pyproject.toml`, a configuration file used by packaging tools, linters, type checkers, et cetera. We will circle back to make maximium use of it. `src/nudge/` for our code, and we self `mkdir tests/` for truth. 

No one-file dumpster fires or import roulette. This is ETC's base: change code? `src/`. Test it? `tests/`. Onboard? 'Code is here, tests there.' Control starts hereâ€”no `sys.path` clownery, no joker code slipping through.

# add qa tools

uv add --group test pytest

 uv run ruff format

# fix issues
 uv run ruff check --fix

```
````

````{tab-item} Test
```{code-block} sh

# test
uv run pytest
````
`````
Boom! `det her er helt vild!`. One file, one job, one test. Change `recommend`? Itâ€™s right there. Test? Run one file. Onboard? â€˜This suggests.â€™ Like toilet paper armâ€™s reachâ€”no messy `sys.path` creeping in. It just works.

Commit or Quit: No Version Control, No Mercy. _Friends Donâ€™t Let Friends Skip Git_. `git add <FILES>; git commit -m "Start project nudge"`. 


##### 1.3 Step 2: Single Responsibilityâ€”Labeled Jars

`Single Responsibility (S)` is Danish order: one thing, one place. It is our path to ETC. To keep control: change one part, others sip coffee; test one job; onboard with â€˜this does this.â€™ No delays, no reputation hits.  Every folder, file, function gets one jobâ€”project-wide. 

Let's add `api` without moving toilet paper across the room.
